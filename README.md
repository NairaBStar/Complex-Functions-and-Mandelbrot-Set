# Complex-Functions-and-Mandelbrot-Set
Complex function grapher and Mandelbrot set maker in Python.

For ComplexFuncGrapher.py, change the s variable to whatever function you want to graph (in terms of w).

For Mandelbrot2D.py, change w = w * w + 1 to whatever function you want to iterate (keep the +1 at the end).

The library needed to run these files is matplotlib. On Windows, use the command

pip install matplotlib

To install this library.
